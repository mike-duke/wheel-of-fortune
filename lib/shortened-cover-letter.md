I have spent the last year and a couple of months in an intense and detailed Front End Development program focused on creating small applications and projects in JavaScript, jQuery, the React ecosystem, HTML and CSS both individually and as part of small groups over one to two week sprints. I pride myself in being able to communicate effectively with a wide variety of people and departments in order to perform the best work possible in the right amount of time. I was able to demonstrate this ability both in my time in the automotive business as well as at Arcadis, where I frequently had to work with project managers, billers, controllers, and other individuals from all over the company. I have also been in charge of my own team and department in the past, so I know what goes into getting the best outcome from a group of people while also helping them maintain a work/life balance. 

I enjoy working on creative and interesting projects with individuals from different disciplines and backgrounds, and I've been praised in previous positions for my ability to see the big picture and act toward goals that benefit the company as well as the client. I believe that I would make a strong addition to your team and I look forward to hearing from you.
